      content="The website features a dynamic background color that transitions from white to black over the course of 365 days from its creation date. It dynamically updates the background color of the webpage based on the number of days remaining. Each day, the background color becomes slightly darker, gradually transitioning to black over the course of the year. After 365 days have passed, the countdown resets, and the background color transition begins again, ensuring that the website continuously cycles through the white-to-black transition every 366 days. The idea is to have a year-long experience within an online digital space."
